## SentinelOne Hunting

In the spirit of keyboardcruch's hunt, this hunt pack strives to hunt for various TTPs at the top of the pyramid of pain, across the stages of the MITRE ATT&CK framework. Not really sure how to contribute to their project or I would just do that. Each root level can be plugged in as a Star Custom Rule (formerly known as Watchlist), but I will break out each rule individually to help explain each one. Keep in mind Star Custom Rules need to be monitored, they will not generate an alert like regular S1 alerts. This will be slowly added to in order to as each rule is individually tested and baselined for effectiveness.

References so far to build out rules:
