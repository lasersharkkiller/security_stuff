## SentinelOne Hunting

In the spirit of keyboardcrunch's hunt, this hunt pack strives to hunt for various TTPs at the top of the pyramid of pain, across the stages of the MITRE ATT&CK framework. Not really sure how to contribute to their project or I would just try to be a contributor. Each root level can be plugged in as a Star Custom Rule (formerly known as Watchlist).

References so far to build out rules:

Elastic rules to be converted: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/security/current/unusual-parent-child-relationship.html

Good Hunting
