## SentinelOne Hunting

In the spirit of keyboardcruch's hunt, this hunt pack strives to hunt for various TTPs at the top of the pyramid of pain, across the stages of the MITRE ATT&CK framework. Not really sure how to contribute to their project or I would just do that. Since Star Custom Rules (formerly known as Watchlist) limit operators to 20, you will have to run the root level queries manually as Loaded Queries. I have broken out each rule individually to help explain each one when they trigger. I will be slowly adding rules to in order to properly baseline for effectiveness.
