## SentinelOne Hunting

In the spirit of @keyboardcruch 's hunt, this hunt pack strives to hunt for various TTPs at the top of the pyramid of pain, across the stages of the MITRE ATT&CK framework. Not really sure how to contribute to their project or I would just do that. Each root level can be plugged in as a Star Custom Rule (formerly known as Watchlist). Keep in mind Star Custom Rules need to be monitored, they will not generate an alert like regular S1 alerts. This will be slowly added to in order to properly baseline rules for effectiveness.

References so far to build out rules:

Good Hunting
